# Join the Stajich Lab
Our lab welcomes applicants from any race, ethnicity, religion, national origin, gender identity, gender expression, caregiver and family commitments, political affiliation, sexual orientation, and eligible age or disability status. Furthermore, we are committed to maintaining a supportive and collaborative lab environment. We encourage exploratory inquiries!

Our lab doesn’t generally post for specific positions, so please reach out! We are interested in engaging you in a conversation about your scientific background and goals for your future career (in academia, industry, or other ventures). We strive to provide excellent training across a wide range of computational and experimental techniques.
<br/>



## Graduate training
Students will be encouraged to apply principles of evolution to questions in fungal biology using approaches that take advantage of genetic, genomic, and computational tools.  We focus on several model organisms in the laboratory but are open to additional approaches by independent-minded and motivated individuals.
