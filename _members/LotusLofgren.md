description: "Dr Lotus Lofgren joined the lab in Fall 2019 and is working on population genomics of Aspergillus fumigatus. Her PhD work at the University of Minnesota focused on comparative genomics and evolution of the fungus Suillus.

I study mycology and ecology, write about science, code, and make scientific illustrations.

I’m currently a postdoc in the Stajich Lab at the University of California Riverside. I'm broadly interested in the mechanisms structuring fungal community dynamics, and address these questions using molecular methods, comparative genomics, population genetics, and bioinformatics. Current projects are focused on fungal host specificity and co-evolution, fungal virulence, guild occupation, trait and genome evolution, and genomic tool development. 

I’m passionate about increasing diversity in STEM, inclusive pedagogy, science communication, and bringing attention to issues of access and accessibility across university levels. 

I received my Ph.D. from the University of Minnesota in 2019 and now live in sunny SoCal with my husband, Clayton, and our Blue Healer, Kjempe. When I’m not at the lab, I ride bikes, make ferments and found object art, garden, collect bad 90’s punk music, and (of course), hunt for mushrooms. "
